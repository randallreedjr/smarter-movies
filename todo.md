- ~~rename url -> fandango_url~~
- ~~Link to fandango to buy ticket for showtime (some showtimes missing links)~~
- Hide expired showtimes
- Improve theater name matching
- ~~Pull movie ratings from rotten tomatoes api~~
- Add partials for displaying theaters, movies, and showtimes
- Upgrade to AJAX
- ~~Sort by tomatometer, only display top 5~~
- Improve rotten tomatoes movie title matching
- Figure out how to cache API calls
- Better handling of 3D showtimes -- possibly via a boolean column
